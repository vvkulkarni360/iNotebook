# My Awesome Notes App

Welcome to my MERN stack project! ðŸš€ In this project, I've built a notes application where each user can create their account and manage their own notes.

## Features

- **User-Based Notes:** Each user has their own account, and only their notes are displayed.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete notes.
- **Note Details:** Users can add a title, description, and tags to each note.

## Highlights

One of the key features of this project is the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Here's what makes it special:

- **JWT Generation:** A JWT is generated for each user upon authentication.
- **Middleware Verification:** The JWT is verified for every CRUD operation using middleware, ensuring secure access.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed for enhanced security. Even I cannot access the user's notes!

## Challenges Faced

While developing this project, I encountered a few challenges:

- **Understanding useContext:** Initially, using the useContext hook was a bit confusing, but now I've mastered it.
- **JWT Verification:** I faced technical difficulties with JWT verification, even though the syntax was correct. It took some time to resolve.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I'm proud of the end result! ðŸŽ‰
